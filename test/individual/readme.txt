These are individual tests intended to check for reasonable numeric results, independent of comparisons with Acoustic Toolbox BELLHOP.

eigen_arrival: Test the 'V' and 'v' modes that generate both arrivals and associated eigenrays. Mostly a test that the output files are generated and parse. compare the files from 'V', 'E', and 'A' modes (and/or associated binary versions with lower case letters). Note that it works around bugs in how influence is identified by using two receivers.
